The objective was to create a weather forecast that a user could input a city into the search box and see both the current weather as well as five day outlook. An API key was requested for open weather and used to pull information for the forecast. Multiple factors that are pulled include temperature, wind speed, humidity etc. There are three files, HTML, Javascript and CSS. JQuery was used for Javascript.
